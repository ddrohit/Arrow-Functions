# Arrow-Functions
A brief understanding of arrow function in javascript

# Introduction
Arrow functions are quite a beauty in javascript, which allows programers to take off the burden of defining the functions/methods with a function keyword.

# Sample Example
As the name defines this functions are defined by a symbol of arrow not this -> but this => (equal too followed by a greaterthan symbol) 
```javascript
//Without using a Arrow Key Word                                   
                                                              
var helloworld = function(){ console.log("Hello world"); }     
helloworld();                                                 
                                                              
//With using a Arrow function 

var helloworld = () => { console.log("Hello world"); }
helloworld();
```
